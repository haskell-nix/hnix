# ChangeLog

## [(diff)](https://github.com/haskell-nix/hnix/compare/0.13.1...master#files_bucket) WIP

* GHC 9.0 support.

* HNix switched to pre-0.9 style of log (aka "no log"). We temporarily stopped producing log, choosing effectiveness over writing about it.

* All changes seem trivial (from the inside). There is no changes in `Nix.Expr.Shorthands` module. Would there be difficulties in migration - please write to us - we would tackle & solve it togather.

A partial log:

* Breaking:

  * `Nix.Effects`:
    * rm `pathExits` in favour of `doesPathExist` (in `Nix.Render`: `class MonadFile`: `doesPathExist`)

  * `Nix.Var`: was found being superflous ([report](https://github.com/haskell-nix/hnix/issues/946)), so reduced. use `Control.Monad.Ref` instead.

  * `Nix.Normal`
    * rename `opaque(,->Val)`, indicate that it is a literal.
  
  * `Nix.Thunk`:
    * `class MonadThunkId m => MonadThunk{,F} t m a`:
      * rename `query(M->){,F}`

* Additional:

  * `Nix.Utils`:
    * added type `TransformF`

  * `Nix.Eval`:
    * added fun:
      * `evalContent`
      * `addMetaInfo`
      
  * `Nix.Types.Assumption`:
    * added instances:
      * `Assumption`: `{Semigroup,Monoid,One}`

  * `Nix.Type.Env`:
    * added instances:
      * `Env`: `{Semigroup,Monoid,One}`
  
  * `Nix`:
    * changed argument order:
      * `nixEval`:
        
        ```haskell
        -- was:
          => Maybe FilePath -> Transform g (m a) -> Alg g (m a) -> Fix g -> m a
        -- became:
          => Transform g (m a) -> Alg g (m a) -> Maybe FilePath -> Fix g -> m a
        ```
        
  * `Nix.Normal`
    * add `thunkVal` literal & use it where appropriate `{deThunk, removeEffects}`
      
  * `Nix.Thunk.Basic`:
    * export `deferred`

  * [(link)](https://github.com/haskell-nix/hnix/pull/859/files) [(link)](https://github.com/haskell-nix/hnix/pull/863/files) [(link)](https://github.com/haskell-nix/hnix/pull/866/files) `Nix.Thunk`: `class MonadThunk t m a | t -> m, t -> a`. Class was initially designed with Kleisli arrows (`v -> m a`) in mind, which where put to have the design open and inviting customization & integration. Those functional arguments are for custom implementation, so  which in reality of the project were never used and HNax just "essentially" (simplifying, because `pure` was mixed with monadic binds to `f`) was passing `pure` into them (actually, `f <=< pure`). These Kliesli functors got arguments sorted properly and were moved to a `MonadThunkF` class and names gained `*F`. And `MonadThunk` now does only what is needed, for example `force` gets the thunk and computes it. All `MonadThunk{,F}` functions become with a classic Haskell arguments order, specialized, and got more straigh-forward to understand and use, and so now they tail recurse also.
      
      Now, for example, instead of `force t f` use it as `v <- force t` `f =<< force t`, or `f <=< force`.
      
      tl;dr: results:
      
      ```haskell
      class MonadThunkId m => MonadThunk t m a | t -> m, t -> a where
      
        thunkId  :: t -> ThunkId m
      
        thunk    :: m a -> m t
      
        queryM   :: m a -> t -> m a
        -- old became `queryMF`
      
        force    :: t -> m a
        -- old became `forceF`
      
        forceEff :: t -> m a
        -- old became `forceEffF`
      
        further  :: t -> m t
        -- old became `furtherF`
      
      
      -- | Class of Kleisli functors for easiness of customized implementation developlemnt.
      class MonadThunkF t m a | t -> m, t -> a where

        queryMF   :: (a   -> m r) -> m r -> t -> m r
        -- was :: t -> m r -> (a   -> m r) -> m r

        forceF    :: (a   -> m r) -> t   -> m r
        -- was :: t   -> (a   -> m r) -> m r

        forceEffF :: (a   -> m r) -> t   -> m r
        -- was :: t   -> (a   -> m r) -> m r

        furtherF  :: (m a -> m a) -> t   -> m t
        -- was :: t   -> (m a -> m a) -> m t

      ```

As a result, `demand` now gets optimized by GHC and also tail recurse. Please, use `f =<< demand t`, or just use `demandF`, while `demandF` in fact just `kleisli =<< demand t`.
      
      ```haskell
      class MonadValue v m where
      
        demand :: v       ->         m v
        -- old became `demandF`

        inform :: v -> m v
        -- old became `informF`
      

      class MonadValueF v m where

        demandF :: (v -> m r) -> v -> m r
        -- was :: v -> (v -> m r) -> m r

        informF :: (m v -> m v) -> v -> m v
        -- was :: v -> (m v -> m v) -> m v
      ```
      
  * [(link)](https://github.com/haskell-nix/hnix/pull/863/files) `Nix.Normal`: `normalizeValue` removed first functional argument that was passing the function that did the thunk forcing. Now function provides the thunk forcing. Now to normalize simply use `normalizeValue v`. Old implementation now is `normalizeValueF`.

## [(diff)](https://github.com/haskell-nix/hnix/compare/0.11.1...0.12.0#files_bucket) 0.12.0 (2021-01-05)

* *Disclaimer*: Current `derivationStrict` primOp implementation and so every evaluation of a derivation into a store path currently relies on the `hnix-store-remote`, which for those operations relies on the running `nix-daemon`, and so operations use/produce effects into the `/nix/store`. Be cautious - it is effectful.

* Introduction:
  * New module `Nix.Effects.Derivation`.
  * Operations on derivations:
    * old got principled implementations.
    * also new operations got introduced.
  * Implementation of the `derivationStrict` primOp.

* Breaking:

    * `addPath'` got principled into `addToStore`.
    * `toFile_` got principled into `addTextToStore'`.
    * For help & easy migration you may use `addPath` & `toFile_` `addTextToStore` standalone functions in the module.

[Detailed info](https://github.com/haskell-hvr/cryptohash-sha512/pull/5#issuecomment-752796913). We promise to attend to this issue, probably by migrating to `cryptonite` in the nearest releases.

Future note: The HNix is a big project. During the initial development and currently the API for simplicity exposes allmost all functions, types, etc. Big open API means a big effort to create/maintain a quite noisy changelog and you parsing through it, and also creates a frequent requirements to mark releases as major and bother you due to some type changes in some parts that may not be used or applicable to be public API.

This year the most gracious API clean-up would happen, we would check and keep open what Hackage projects are using from the API, and the other parts would be open on the request by a way of rapid minor releases. That clean-up is also a work toward splitting the project into several packages some time in the future (split would be into something like Expressions, Evaluation, Executable, Extra), which migration also would be done most thoughful and graceful as possible, with as much easiness and automation provided for migration downstream as possible. If all goes as planned - all downstream would need to do is to get and run our script that would migrate our old map of module imports to new ones, and maybe manually add those newly formed packages into `.cabal` description.

If it is possible, please, try to switch & use the higher-level API functions where it is applicable. Thank you.

  * [(link)](https://github.com/haskell-nix/hnix/pull/739) Parentheses now are properly included in the location annotation for Nix expressions, change of `nixParens` in `module Nix.Parser` essentially results in the change of all module `nix*` function results, essentially making results of the whole module more proper.

* Additional:
  * [(link)](https://github.com/haskell-nix/hnix/pull/741) Fix QQ Text lifting error: work around of [GHC#12596 "can't find interface-file declaration"](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/12596).
  * [(link)](https://github.com/haskell-nix/hnix/pull/744) Fix comments inclusion into location annotations, by using pre-whitespace position for source end locations.


### [(diff)](https://github.com/haskell-nix/hnix/compare/0.10.0...0.10.1#files_bucket) 0.10.1 (2020-09-13)

* Additional:
  * [(link)](https://github.com/haskell-nix/hnix/pull/715) `{Binding, NExpr, NExprF, NKeyName}` gained `Ord1` instances.
    * These instances were required by downstream projects to be able to use newer HNix.
  * [(link)](https://github.com/haskell-nix/hnix/pull/712) CLI gained `--long-version` option for gathering a detailed debug information.
    * Currently, reports Git commit and its date.
    * [(link)](https://github.com/haskell-nix/hnix/issues/718) Currently does not work in case of use of the `nix-build`, in which case simply returns `UNKNOWN` placeholder.
